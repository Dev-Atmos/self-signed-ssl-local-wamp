# Self-Signed SSL Certificate for Local Development (WAMP + VirtualHost)

This repository provides a step-by-step guide for generating a **self-signed SSL certificate** for local development using **WAMP** on Windows. It helps avoid browser \"Not Secure\" warnings by using a **locally trusted Certificate Authority (CA)**.

## âœ… Features
- Self-signed certificate trusted by browsers (with SAN support)
- Works with **Apache VirtualHosts** on WAMP
- Uses custom development domains like `dev.localtest.com`
- Helps simulate production-like HTTPS environments

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure
/ssl/
â”œâ”€â”€ rootCA.key # Private key for the Root CA
â”œâ”€â”€ rootCA.crt # Root CA certificate (install this in Windows trust store)
â”œâ”€â”€ dev.localtest.com.key # Private key for the local development domain
â”œâ”€â”€ dev.localtest.com.csr # CSR for the local development domain
â”œâ”€â”€ dev.localtest.com.crt # Signed certificate for the local development domain
â”œâ”€â”€ dev.ext # SAN configuration for OpenSSL
/www/your_project/
â””â”€â”€ index.php # Example index file for testing
