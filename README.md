# Self-Signed SSL Certificate for Local Development (WAMP + VirtualHost)

This repository provides a step-by-step guide and necessary configuration files for generating a **self-signed SSL certificate** for local development using **WAMP** on Windows. It helps avoid browser "Not Secure" warnings by using a **locally trusted Certificate Authority (CA)**.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

* Self-signed certificate trusted by browsers (with SAN support)
* Works with **Apache VirtualHosts** on WAMP
* Uses custom development domains like `dev.localtest.com`
* Helps simulate production-like HTTPS environments

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Guide

### Install OpenSSL (if not available)

Download and install OpenSSL for Windows from: [https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
Add OpenSSL to System Path:

Open **System Properties ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Environment Variables**.

Under **System variables**, find and edit Path.

Add the path to your OpenSSL bin directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin).

Restart Command Prompt or terminal to apply changes.

### 1. Generate Root Certificate Authority (CA)

```bash
openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out rootCA.crt
```

### 2. Generate Private Key and CSR for Local Domain

```bash
openssl genrsa -out dev.localtest.com.key 2048
openssl req -new -key dev.localtest.com.key -out dev.localtest.com.csr
```

### 3. Create SAN Configuration (`dev.ext`)

```ini
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = dev.localtest.com
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
```

### 4. Generate SSL Certificate for Local Domain

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in dev.localtest.com.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out dev.localtest.com.crt -days 825 -sha256 -extfile dev.ext
```

### 5. Trust the Root CA Certificate (Windows)

1. Double-click `rootCA.crt`.
2. Click **Install Certificate**.
3. Select **Local Machine**.
4. Place in **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.
5. Restart your browser.

### 6. Apache VirtualHost Configuration

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName dev.localtest.com
    DocumentRoot "D:/wamp64/www/your_project"

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "D:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.x/conf/ssl/dev.localtest.com.crt"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "D:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.x/conf/ssl/dev.localtest.com.key"

    <Directory "D:/wamp64/www/your_project">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Ensure `mod_ssl` is enabled and VirtualHosts are configured properly in Apache.

### 7. Update Windows `hosts` File

```plaintext
127.0.0.1 dev.localtest.com
```

### 8. Example PHP File (`/www/your_project/index.php`)

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

* Restart **WAMP Apache** services.
* Visit: `https://dev.localtest.com`
* Browser should show **Secure** connection.
